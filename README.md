# NLP-Models
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a pre-trained natural language processing (NLP) model developed by Google. BERT is a neural network-based model that can understand the context of words in a sentence by pre-training on a large corpus of text.
BERT uses a transformer architecture, which is a type of neural network that is particularly effective for processing sequential data such as text. The transformer architecture uses attention mechanisms to focus on important parts of the input sequence when making predictions.
One of the key features of BERT is its ability to pre-train on a large corpus of text using an unsupervised learning approach. During pre-training, BERT is trained to predict missing words in a sentence, as well as to determine whether two sentences are related or not. This pre-training step helps BERT to learn contextualized representations of words that are useful for a wide range of downstream NLP tasks.
After pre-training, BERT can be fine-tuned on specific NLP tasks such as question answering, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition. Fine-tuning involves training the model on a smaller, task-specific dataset to further optimize its performance on that particular task.
Overall, BERT has achieved state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of NLP tasks, making it a powerful tool for natural language processing applications.
